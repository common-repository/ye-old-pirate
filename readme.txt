Plugin outputs existing posts so that it like it was narrated by a Pirate

== Description ==
Tested using 5.8 beta

This plug-in is very simple & uses very basic php code concepts . 
The qualifying requirments for using this plugin are that you are mildly eccentric 

The plug-in filters your WordPress posted content; it does not replace your saved posts;instead 
while the plug-in is activated it  substitutes key words using an array of key pairs to output that people see.
When plug-in is deactivated output reverts to normal. 

To maximize degree of Pirate lingo try to include the following words in new  posts  :

the,yes,stagnant,hey,call,crew,clothes,work shy,beggars,afraid,hang,stop,cover,minion,goods,dawn,duelling pistols,eggs,cackle fruit,
barrel,knife,stupid,hanged,rum,drunk,mop,pirate,push,sabotage,clean,you,pay attention,cheat,is,are,fool,whinger,lazy,
		smelly,basement,cockroach,pull,wave,leave,rubbish,sailor,tie,no.
